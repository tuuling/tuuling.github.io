            <div class="flex flex-col pt-8 prose">
                <p>I built my first website at the age of 14, the year was 2002. My first full-time job as a software
                    developer was in 2008. Over the years I have worked in many different companies and accumulated a
                    great deal of expertise. I have always tried to keep learning new things and finding new
                    challenges.</p>

                <p>After working on several software projects, I've realized that having technical expertise alone is
                    insufficient for a project's success. Efficient project and personnel management is often the
                    underlying pillar of a successful software project. I believe that an Agile mindset is the best tool
                    to achieve this. Not only is it helpful for delivering on time, but it's also useful for developing
                    a robust technical foundation for the project.</p>
                <p>Today, I am confident in all aspects of developing and setting up a web application. I regard myself
                    as a true full-stack developer.</p>
                <p>With my extensive industry experience, I can quickly identify both technical and process
                    inefficiencies that may hinder project progress. I can offer actionable solutions to these
                    challenges and implement them on time.</p>

                    <p>My main focus has always been front-end development - it's what I enjoy the most.</p>
                    <p>I am very experienced with <strong>Angular</strong>, having used it since the first version. I
                        have occasionally used
                        <strong>React</strong> when needed. I write all my applications in <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
                        For CSS, I have used
                        <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Material</strong>, and
                        <strong>Foundation</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="prose">
                    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 not-prose">Backend</h2>
                    <p><strong>Node.js</strong> with <strong>NestJS</strong> framework is my preferred choice for
                        backend development. Additionally, I
                        have extensive experience in <strong>PHP</strong> using <strong>Yii2</strong> and
                        <strong>Java</strong> with
                        <strong>Spring/Hibernate</strong>. I am also highly
                        proficient in setting up and working with <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="prose">
                    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 not-prose">Devops</h2>
                    <p>
                        Usually, when writing full-stack applications I've had to set up and configure the server on
                        which it will run. I have had to set up servers manually and used automation tools such as
                        <strong>Ansible</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and
                        <strong>Helm</strong>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="prose">
                    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 not-prose">Other</h2>
                    <p>I know my way around using <strong>LLMs</strong> to add <strong>AI</strong> functionalities to
                        applications. I use <strong>LangChain</strong> as much as possible and
                        <strong>Postgres pgvector</strong> for saving and querying vector embeddings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have picked up <strong>Photography</strong>, <strong>Videography</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong>
                        as a hobby. I won't do your wedding, but
                        I can take portraits and do small promotional video clips.</p>
